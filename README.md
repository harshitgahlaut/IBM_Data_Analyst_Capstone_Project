# IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project

For this project, let's suppose we've just joined a renowned global IT and business consulting services firm as a Data Analyst. Renowned for its prowess in IT solutions and its cadre of seasoned IT consultants, our organization consistently evaluates data to anticipate upcoming skill needs, ensuring we stay at the forefront of evolving technologies and maintain our competitive edge.

As a Data Analyst, our role involves aiding this endeavor. We've been assigned the responsibility of gathering data from diverse channels and discerning trends for this year's report on emerging skills.

Our initial objective entails gathering the most sought-after programming skills from a range of sources, including job postings, training portals, and surveys.

Once we have collected enough data, we will begin analyzing the data and identify insights and trends.

Each phase of the data analysis process is outlined in separate notebooks within this repository.
